## HacVersionListBot is now deprecated.  It is recommended to discontinue its use.

**There have been many updates to Horizon since HacVersionListBot, it is now outdated deeply in most all respects.  It makes little attempt to be accurate to Horizons original behaviour. Its use constitutes a significant risk of the certificate being banned.**
